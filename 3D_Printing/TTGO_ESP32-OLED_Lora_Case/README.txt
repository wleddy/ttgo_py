# Summary

This is a case for the TTGO ESP32 Lora board, as purchased from Banggood as the 2pcs Wemos TTGO board with OLED [here](https://www.banggood.com/2Pcs-Wemos-TTGO-LORA32-868915Mhz-ESP32-LoRa-OLED-0_96-Inch-Blue-Display-p-1239769.html).  There are other cases on Thingiverse that are similar to this case, but either the antenna connection did not exist, or it was in the wrong location for this board.

After printing, you'll need some M3 screws to hold the lid on the case.  The fit is intentionally tight on both the board and the antenna, but it works quite well for me.
